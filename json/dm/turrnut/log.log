the bot says to 917059800154652732 -> A letter to Nickels the former admin
Hello Nickels,

Welcome back to the server. I am glad that you have reappeared, because it answered some members' questions as to who you are. However, there are a few things I need to address:

You are now a "former admin", you have resigned from admin 3 months ago. Therefore, as a Turrnut Republic resident, you unfortunately do not have the power to make an announcement in the news channel. I will remove your permission from doing so.;
I am sorry for the trauma that happened to you and am sorry that you have lost a friend. However, this is a personal matter between the two of us. I don't grant you permission to discuss such matters in my server. You see, you don't any more trauma, I too want no more drama(sorry for the rhyming) in my server, losing a friend is such a personal business, that I feel like it would not be appropriate to discuss in my server with the "public". What happened was sad, but you can't ping @ here because of that(This might be a violation to Rule #6). Our server members will not understand the context, so there is no need to lie to them;
Unfortunately, I can allow neither your emojis nor mentions of your name removed. As you see, you played an important part in this server's history, and by erasing your messages I am erasing the history of this country, which I don't feel inclined to do. Additionally, as you upload an emoji to the server, you are essentianlly giving the server permission to this emoji. In other words, you transferred the copyright from you the creator to the Turrnut Republic;

Again, I feel sorry about your mental state right now and hope you can recover soon. I suggest you to forget about me, so you can have a great weekend and live a traumaless remainder of your life.

Happy holidays,
Turrnut  | 2023-12-08 20:51:13.711009
