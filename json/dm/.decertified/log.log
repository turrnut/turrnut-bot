 Hey, I will be taking my leave because alot of people have been forming againts me, most people will be happy because I've been a "bad moderator" most people don't understand why I'm timing them out they're stupid, these are my final notes and I will not be joining back, I've had a good time made so many friends and half of them have turned againts me. I hate my self now thanks for making me feel that, I tried to treat you guys with respect but you guys are treating me rudely and bobbie none of my jokes are ever offensive, "You always joke around" just shut the fuck up and you know why I've been so rude lately hell you're the only one I told, Turrnut thank you for being a bad friend towards me. I appreciate you guys for the hate and I hope you guys take care of yourselves for now, bye. | 2024-11-14 21:20:41.167545
